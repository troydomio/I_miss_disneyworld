# I Miss Disney World ðŸª„

##Progression Log
### October 31, 2021

* Today I started a new project inspired by:
 - <a href="http://imissmybar.com/" target="_blank">Maverick's 'I Miss My Bar' </a>
 - <a href="https://imissmycafe.com/" target="_blank">Reagan Henke's 'I Miss My Cafe' </a>

I wanted to make my own version of this project, except Disney themed because it is the most magical place on earth and I cannot wait until my next trip! I crafted out the UI, and am currently working on creating my own audio player with CSS + JavaScript (which is quite the task it turns out!).

What's left?
[] finish the audio player UI
[] give audio player UI some funtionality and add the mp3 sounds
[] make the left div wand a theme toggler
